# First-Website_AleMayry
This is a reuploaded version of my first website made for a Laurea UAS beginner course "Website Development".
(Aleksi MÃ¤yry R0244-3025 Verkkosivukehitys verkkosivut, uudelleen julkaistu.)

## General information

The website was originally created in 2022. Since it was published with the namesake github.io domain, I decided to move the contents to a dedicated repository.

During the course, the topic I chose for the website was "Hamsters and hamster-care" inspired by my late pet hamster Tori. 

## Technologies used

This starter project uses basic technologies and languages, like HTML and CSS. Some styles for components, such as the _nav-bar_ and _footer_ are created utilizing Bootstrap -framework.
